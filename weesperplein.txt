Weesperplein is an underground metro station in the city centre of Amsterdam, Netherlands.
Served by lines 51, 53, and 54 of the Amsterdam Metro, it was constructed using caissons
with a length and width of 40 metres (130 ft).
It has two floors: the upper floor, with a station hall and stores, and the lower floor, containing the tracks.
Construction started in August 1970, and the first test rides passed through in January 1977.
Extensive tests were carried out in September that year before it opened on 16 October.
Another platform was built below the existing one, as the station was originally planned
to be the intersection of two lines.
This platform was instead used as a fallout shelter with a capacity of 5,000 people
when most of the network was cancelled in 1975 following protests against the destruction of houses.
The shelter was not maintained from 1999 onwards, and equipment was removed in 2004
to make way for smoke-extraction machinery.
Repairs during a renovation in 2011 were of poor quality and were redone several times.
Weesperplein was renovated again in 2017â€“2018 when a new elevator and two more staircases
were added between the hall and tracks.
It was the fifth most-used station of the Amsterdam Metro in 2018.
